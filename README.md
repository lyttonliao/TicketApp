## Part 3

Q: Tell us about the possible reasons that the filter your implemented in part 2 did not help the customer experience. What could you change to improve the filter experience, and why do you think it would be better for the customer?

A: I believe that providing a wider array of options for customers is important to their experience. Filtering by cities removes other appealing options. When selecting a city, it would be advantageous to also include events within a specified radius or events in neighboring cities. However, I am unable to implement an area search feature with the information provided. 

If there were a larger sample of events, another potential issue could be that customers also factored in price, date, etc... In that scenario, the customer would have to manually search a long list of events for the desired date and price range.
